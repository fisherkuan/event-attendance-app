# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### Do I need to login?

No, login is not required for any operation in the webapp, including viewing calendars and RSVPing to events.

### Do I need to join the Leuven Taiwanese group?

Only if you want to create or edit events on the 揪團啦 calendar. For viewing events and RSVPing, no group membership is needed.

### Can I install this app on my phone?

Yes! This is a Progressive Web App (PWA). You can install it on your phone's home screen for easy access. Look for the "Add to Home Screen" prompt when visiting on mobile, or use your browser's install option.

## RSVP & Attendance

### How do I RSVP to an event?

1. Browse events in the Events section
2. Click the green "+" button on any future event card
3. Enter your name in the popup
4. Click "Confirm" to submit your RSVP

### Can I change or cancel my RSVP?

Yes, you can remove your RSVP by clicking the red "-" button on the event card, then selecting your name from the dropdown and confirming the removal.

### Can multiple people use the same name to RSVP?

Technically yes, but please use unique names to help event organizers track attendance accurately. Consider adding initials or a nickname if someone else has already used your name.

### What if an event is full?

Some events have attendance limits. If you see "X / Y Attending" and it shows the event is full, you won't be able to RSVP. Contact the event organizer if you'd like to be added to a waitlist.

### Can I RSVP to past events?

No, RSVP is only available for future events. Past events are marked as "Past Event - RSVP Closed."

### How do I see who's attending an event?

Hover over or focus on the attendance count (e.g., "5 Attending") to see a list of all attendees.

### Is my RSVP data private?

Your name and RSVP status are visible to anyone viewing the event. This helps community members see who's attending. Only your name is collected—no email, phone, or other personal information is required.
